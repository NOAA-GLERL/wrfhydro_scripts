this is a basic workflow I set up for comparing wrfhydro streamflow to USGS gages


steps:
0. associate_gage_fid.sh
	this reads in `Route_Link.nc` and prints out a table `gages.txt` with two cols: feature_id, gage_id

1. get_obs.R
	this short script uses the dataRetrieval pkg to grab USGS obs data
		- it uses gages.txt to determine which gages to grab
		- it determines the time frame by user defined `t0` and `tf`
		  !!! USE CAUTION with t0,tf and timezone, dataRetrieval handles timezone in an unintuitive way !!!
	        - it currently subsets more frequent data to only hourly data (no averaging)

	depending on the number of gages and the timeframe, this can be slow (10-15 mins?)
	thats why i only want to have to do this once--it saves the OBS data to an Rdata file which can
	then be loaded in by chanobs2, which then runs very quickly

2. chanobs2.R
	prints skill statistics and draws hydrographs
	




other files:
- myutils2.R
	helper functions called by chanobs2

- gages.txt
	table which pairs up NWM feature IDS with USGS gages
	it may be useful to cut this down (by looking at specific streams, larger streams, etc.) in order to make the number of plots more reasonable
	if so, i would recommend doing this after step 1; this way all the obs are saved but you can analyze a smaller portion
