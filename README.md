##  plotting
As the name implies this area contains scripts that make plots.

Scripts include but are not limited to:
- `spatial_streamflow.R`   spatial plots of the stream network (color-coded by flow; possible to make animations)
- `chanobs.R`    validation of streamflow; skill statistics and hydrographs based on stream gages
- Lindsay will add some more descriptions?
